There are several ways to work around this issue.  One approach is to apply the blur to a parent element that does not have `overflow: hidden;`.  Another is to use a larger container with a larger padding. Here's an example using a larger container:

```css
.container {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  padding: 5px;
  overflow: hidden;
}

.blurred-element {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  filter: blur(5px);
}
```

By adding padding, the blur extends beyond the visible area of the element without being clipped.  Adjust the padding value to control the blur's extent.
