# CSS Blur Clipping with Overflow: hidden
This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue that can arise when using the CSS `filter: blur()` property in conjunction with `overflow: hidden;`.  The blur effect can be unexpectedly clipped, resulting in a less than desirable visual outcome.

The `bug.css` file showcases the problematic code, while `solution.css` presents a potential workaround.

This issue is subtle and can be easily overlooked, making it a valuable case study for developers working with CSS filters and layout.
